            p Find the full documentation and usage examples for all tools included on your CPW instance below. Keep in mind that most tools choose sensible defaults for many options.  If you want to tweak all of the parameters, go ahead, but in most cases you will not need to!
            p All built in tools on your CPW are called "sig_tools". These "sig_tools" operate on Connectivity Map data at the level of differential gene expression signatures as a starting point.

            h3 sig_query_tool
            p The sig_query_tool examines the similarities between a user defined set of gene expression signatures and the signatures in the Connectivity Map database. Both internal and external queries are supported. Internal queries are those that already exist in the Connectivity Map database. External queries are based on user-defined genesets or rank lists.
            p Several measures of similarities are supported. These include correlation metrics: Spearman and Pearson, as well as enrichment metrics: Connectivity Score (cs) and Weighted Connectivity Score (wtcs).
